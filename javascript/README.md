## Quill_Api
  Quill.api is a replacement for the tradininal twitter api that is trying to make it easy to create amd host a bot. While Quill.Api is currently more limited than the official Twitter API We are working hard on adding a lot more, and we will soon be more capable than the official Twitter API. Twitter(X) is not associated with this prodject.

## Installation

Install with npm

```bash
  npm i QuillJs-test
```
    
## Usage/Examples

```javascript
'use strict';
const { Client } = require('quill.api');
const cookies = require("./cookies.json");
const path = require('node:path');

// Path verible for cookies.json file
const JSONpath = path.join(__dirname , '/cookies.json');

const log = (...args) => console.log(process.uptime().toFixed(3), ...args);

const client = new Client.Client({
    driver: "firefox",
    Headless: true,
});


client.on('debug', log);
client.on('ready', () => 
{
      console.log('client ready');
      var draft = new client.Draft().addText('Hello World!').Send();
