# Quill-Api
quill-api is a simple wrapper around selium's API to control twitter and make an bot using it. 

## Who we are

We are all a couple of bored teenagers in school, so don't expect there to be rollouts every week or something like that. Although we are in school, when summer rolls around, we will be able to make more frequent changes to this project. 

Oh, also this is a simple fun project. Twitter, please don't take action against us ðŸ¥º I'm begging.
